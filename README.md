## Description

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

The app is deployed to Heroku and makes use of JawsDB for the backend database.

* MVC Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat;

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten;

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat Me!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right hand side of the page; and

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether eaten or not.
